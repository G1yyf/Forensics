Step 1: Unzip the Download
If the challenge gives you a .zip file, just unzip it and go into the directory:

unzip challenge.zip
cd challenge/
Step 2: Check the Git Logs
Run:

git log
This shows a list of commits. Each one has a long hash (that's the commit ID). These commits usually contain changes made to the repo — and sometimes flags or clues.

Step 3: Look Through the Commits
Pick one of the commit hashes and check it out with:

git show <commit-hash>
This lets you see what was changed in that commit. Sometimes stuff gets deleted or added that's not in the latest version, so look closely.

Step 4: Check the Branches
Sometimes the challenge hides stuff in different branches. Run:

git branch
That’ll show the current branch you're on. To list all branches (including remote ones), you can use:

git branch -a
Step 5: Switch Branches
If you find a branch that looks interesting, switch to it like this:

git checkout <branch-name>
You can always go back to the main branch (usually called main or master) with:

git checkout main
